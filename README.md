# break\_interval

This simple program plays a jingle at a specified interval in minutes. It is
meant to be used as a way to notify the user to take a break when the interval
jingle plays.

    # For usage:
    ./break_interval --help

Running the program with no args will default to playing a jingle every 5
minutes.
